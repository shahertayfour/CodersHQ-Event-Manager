## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll to "2-Step Verification"
3. Click "Get Started" and follow the steps
4. **You must enable 2FA to create App Passwords**

### Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in to your Gmail account
3. Under "App name", type: **Coders HQ Notifications**
4. Click "Create"
5. Copy the 16-character password (format: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file and add your credentials:

```bash
# Your Gmail email address
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com

# The 16-character App Password (remove spaces)
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Example:**
```env
GMAIL_USER=admin@codershq.ae
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

### Step 4: Restart the Backend

```bash
docker compose restart backend
```

Or rebuild if packages changed:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build backend
```

## ‚úÖ Verify It Works

Check the backend logs to confirm email service is configured:

```bash
docker logs chq-backend | grep "Email"
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Email service configured with Gmail
```

## üß™ Testing

1. **Test as User**: Create a new booking at http://localhost:8080
   - You should receive a "Booking Received" email
   - Admin should receive a "New Booking Request" email

2. **Test as Admin**: Approve/Deny the booking
   - User should receive approval/denial email

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Never use your regular Gmail password** - Always use App Password
- **Keep credentials secure** - Don't commit `.env` to git
- App Password works only with Gmail accounts that have 2FA enabled
- Gmail has a sending limit: ~500 emails/day for free accounts

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. Use a dedicated Gmail account for the application (e.g., `noreply@codershq.ae`)
2. Never share your App Password
3. Rotate App Passwords periodically
4. If compromised, revoke the App Password immediately at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Email not sent - transporter not configured"
- Check that `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` are set in `.env`
- Restart the backend container

### "Invalid login"
- Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- Verify 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
- Check for typos in the App Password (remove spaces)

### "Daily sending quota exceeded"
- Gmail free accounts are limited to ~500 emails/day
- Consider upgrading to Google Workspace for higher limits
